                    <p>Hertz is one of the largest car rental companies in the world. It has over 10,000 corporate and
                        franchisee locations. Last week, I tested the usability of the hertz.com website on a computer.
                        This week, a usability test was conducted to determine the ease of use of the website on mobile
                        devices
                        <a href="https://www.hertz.com/">https://www.hertz.com</a> for older adults. This blog provides
                        a summary of this test and its results.

                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Summary of the test</h2>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3 class="subsection">Purpose and methods used</h3>

                    <p>The purpose of this test was to test the Hertz website on a mobile device to see how user
                        friendly it is for older
                        adults. The test was conducted on April 30 through May 2, 2020 via Zoom sessions due to the
                        Covid-19 outbreak.
                        Sessions were recorded with the users’ permission. </p>

                    <p>Each user was asked to log onto the site on a mobile device and I read a script describing that
                        we were testing the
                        usability of the Hertz website. Each user was asked if they had ever used a website to rent a
                        car, and if they had used the Hertz website. The users were asked to perform three tasks and
                        were told to say their thoughts out loud as they performed the tasks. The following tasks were
                        included in the test:</p>




                    <ul>
                        <li>Find Hertz locations near you</li>
                        <li>Assume you are making a one-and-a-half-week trip to Seattle. Find a car that meets your
                            needs and determine how much the rental would cost.</li>
                        <li>Find out what offers are available for AAA members.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>After the test, I looked back at the videos and noted how much time and the number of actions
                        performed on each task. The full test script can be found <a
                            href="img/Post 4 img/Test Script Mobile.pdf"><u>here</u>.</a></p>

                    <h3 class="subsection">Number and demographic summary of participants</h3>

                    <p>In all, there were three participants. Two-thirds identified as male and the average age was
                        64.7. Two-thirds had previously used a website to rent a car, and the same users had used the
                        Hertz website before. One of those users said it had been a significant amount of time since
                        using the Hertz website.
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <h2>Results summary</h2>

                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Task 1</h3>

                    <p>In the first task, they were asked to find Hertz locations near them. </p>

                    <p>The following charts presents the number of steps and time it took the users to complete the
                        task.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 4 img/Steps and Time for Task 1 Mobile.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>


                    <p>Like my previous test using a computer, users gravitated to the reservation functionality to find
                        locations even though the locations feature was a menu item.</p>

                    <p>Each user approached this task in different ways. Using the menu, user 1 quickly found locations
                        in 32 seconds and four steps.

                    </p>

                    <p>User 2 spent almost ten minutes trying to find a location using the pickup locations
                        functionality in the reservation section of the home page. They tried using the names of local
                        cities and zip codes which brought up either no results or locations not near their home. At one
                        point, it displayed locations in other states and foreign countries. They felt like the location
                        feature wasn’t done well and that it was surprisingly difficult. They mentioned that they would
                        likely go to another rental car company because of the poor performance of this feature. </p>

                    <p>Also using the pickup feature, user 3 was able to find a location near their home and finish the
                        task in just over two minutes and nine steps. However, their results were limited to a single
                        location and they didn’t receive information about other locations near them</p>

                    <h3>Task 2</h3>

                    <p>In the second task, the users were asked to make a week and a half reservation and figure how
                        much it would cost.</p>

                    <p>The following charts presents the number of steps and time it took the users to complete the
                        task.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 4 img/Steps and Time for Task 2  Mobile.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>


                    <p>The experience of people in task two was also very similar to using a computer. Because the
                        reservation feature is so prominent on the home page, they were automatically focused on it.</p>

                    <p>Users one and three had a similar experience finishing the task in about two and a half minutes.
                        User two took almost nine minutes to complete the task due to difficulty finding a location.
                        Both users one and two noted that you couldn’t clear the reservation information to allow the
                        user to start over. This made the more cumbersome to use. In the end, all the users thought it
                        was a reasonable experience. </p>

                    <h3>Task 3</h3>

                    <p>In task three, the users were told to find what offers were available for AAA members.</p>

                    <p>The following charts presents the number of steps and time it took the users to complete the
                        task.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 4 img/Steps and Time for Task 3  Mobile.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>User three had no difficulty with this task. They found AAA deals in eighteen seconds and three
                        steps. User one, initially tried to find the information using the menu but couldn’t locate
                        anything about AAA. They then tried the search feature but didn’t find the results they were
                        looking for. They went back to the menu and found deals under the “Rent” sub-menu.
                        Oddly when they returned to the main menu, “Deals” showed up as an option. User three tried the
                        menu but didn’t find anything about deals so they used the search feature three times using
                        different criteria and didn’t find what they were looking for and gave up after about four
                        minutes and eighteen steps.
                    </p>

                    </a>

                    <P></P>


                    <h2>Summary of issues found and next steps</h2>

                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Issues found</h3>

                    <p>The experience was similar to the prior group who used computers. For both task one and three,
                        the users on both types of devices gravitated towards the reservation section instead of the
                        menu. In general, they all recognized the hamburger icon as the menu; however, they rarely went
                        to it making it harder to find things.</p>

                        <p>Unlike on the computer, the deals option didn’t show up in the menu unless they clicked on the
                            “Rent” submenu first. Because of the difficulty in finding the menu option for “Deals” users
                            spent a lot of time searching for AAA deals.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 4 img/Mobile Homepage.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p></p>


                    <h3>Suggested solutions and next steps</h3>

                    <p>As in the prior test, I would recommend a different use of color due to a very bland light on
                        light website. This might help balance the reservation section with the menu and other options
                        on the site.</p>

                    <p>I would also add some features like a clear button on the reservation section to make it easier
                        for users to start over. The other thing would be to put a hyperlink in the reservations section
                        for locations near me. That would highlight that the feature exists without having to use the
                        menu.</p>
