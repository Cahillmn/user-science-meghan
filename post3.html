                    <p>Hertz is one of the largest car rental companies in the world. It has over 10,000 corporate and
                        franchisee locations. A usability test was conducted to determine the ease of use of the website
                        <a href="https://www.hertz.com/">https://www.hertz.com</a> for older adults. This blog provides
                        a summary of this test and its results.

                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Summary of the test</h2>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3 class="subsection">Purpose and methods used</h3>

                    <p>The purpose of this test was to test the Hertz website to see how user friendly it is for older
                        adults. The test was conducted on April 25, 2020 via Zoom sessions due to the Covid-19 outbreak.
                        Sessions were recorded with the users’ permission. </p>

                    <p>Each user was asked to log onto the site and I read a script describing that we were testing the
                        usability of the Hertz website. Each user was asked if they had ever used a website to rent a
                        car, and if they had used the Hertz website. The users were asked to perform three tasks and
                        were told to say their thoughts out loud as they performed the tasks. The following tasks were
                        included in the test:</p>




                    <ul>
                        <li>Find Hertz locations near you</li>
                        <li>Assume you are making a one-and-a-half-week trip to Seattle. Find a car that meets your
                            needs and determine how much the rental would cost.</li>
                        <li>Find out what offers are available for AAA members.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>After the test, I looked back at the videos and noted how much time and the number of actions
                        performed on each task.  The full test script can be found <a href="img/Post 3 img/Test Script.pdf"><u>here</u>.</a></p>

                    <h3 class="subsection">Number and demographic summary of participants</h3>

                    <p>In all, there were three participants. Two-thirds identified as female and the average age was
                        69.7. All had previously used a website to rent a car, but none had ever used the Hertz website.
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <h2>Results summary</h2>

                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Task 1</h3>

                    <p>In the first task, they were asked to find Hertz locations near them. </p>

                    <p>The following charts presents the number of steps and time it took the users to complete the
                        task.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 3 img/Steps and time for Task 1.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>I observed for user 1, they didn’t have a menu across the top of the website nor did they have
                        the standard utilities in the upper right corner. Instead this user only had a hamburger menu
                        displayed in the upper left -hand corner. This made it harder for user 1 to find locations. They
                        were scrolling up and down or trying to use the reservations section for almost three minutes
                        until they noticed the hamburger menu and found the locations.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 3 img/Hamburger.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>For users 2 and 3, they had the standard menu across the top and utilities in the upper
                        right-hand corner. Particularly for user 2, this made it easier to navigate the site and find
                        the locations. They accomplished the task in nine steps in less than three minutes.</p>

                    <p>All users were drawn to the reservations section and spent time trying to find locations there.
                        Although user 3 found the location menu, he still used the reservations section. After fifteen
                        steps and three minutes and 43 seconds, the user abandoned the task and never found the
                        locations. </p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 3 img/Reservations.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <h3>Task 2</h3>

                    <p>In the second task, the users were asked to make a week and a half reservation and figure how
                        much it would cost.</p>

                    <p>The following charts presents the number of steps and time it took the users to complete the
                        task.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 3 img/Steps and time for Task 2.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>This task was much easier for users to figure out. They immediately went to the reservation
                        section which as noted above was featured on the homepage. The time and steps for all users were
                        similar ranging from eleven to fifteen steps and ranging from three minutes and twenty- four
                        seconds to four minutes and forty-six seconds. It varied based on how much they reviewed options
                        provided on the site.</p>

                    <h3>Task 3</h3>

                    <p>In task three, the users were told to find what offers were available for AAA members.</p>

                    <p>The following charts presents the number of steps and time it took the users to complete the
                        task.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 3 img/Steps and time for Task 3.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>User 2 immediately used the menu to locate deals and found the AAA discounts in three steps and
                        eleven seconds. Due to not having a complete menu, user 1 scrolled up and down the page looking
                        for any reference to deals. They eventually went to the footer and clicked on a link to travel
                        partners where there was a menu and they were able to find the deals in the menu.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 3 img/User 1 menu.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>After observing a place to enter a discount code, user 3 searched for AAA and found information
                        on how to enter a code but didn’t find information about AAA in the deals part of the website.
                        They stopped the task after sixteen steps and three minutes and thirty seven seconds without
                        finding all deals for AAA members.</p>

                    <h2>Summary of issues found and next steps</h2>

                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Issues found</h3>

                    <p>I found two main issues. One was the occurrence of the hamburger menu in user 1’s experience
                        which made it hard to navigate the website. The user spent a significant amount of time
                        scrolling through the site looking for links related to their search. This user was using an
                        apple computer but I tested the site myself using an apple computer with the same operating
                        system and version of safari. I found the menu worked fine for me.</p>

                    <p>The other was the prominence of the reservation section that drew users to it therefore
                        distracting them from other options available on the page. This is a difficult one to solve
                        because Hertz’s main purpose is to rent cars so they want it to be easy for people to find where
                        to rent a car.</p>

                    <h3>Suggested solutions and next steps</h3>

                    <p>My first suggestion if this was a real test is that I would want to follow up with user 1 to
                        understand what setting or configuration was causing the menu issues.</p>

                    <p>For the second issue, I would recommend a different use of color due to a very bland light on
                        light website. This might help balance the reservation section with the menu and other options
                        on the site.</p>
