                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">

                        </a></center>

                    <p>Thymes is an independent company located in Minneapolis, Minnesota that produces and sells
                        handcrafted bath/body and home fragrance products. Their website,
                        <a href="http://www.thymes.com/">http://www.thymes.com</a>, provides information on available
                        products that can be purchased online. The intended audience of this site are people who are
                        interested in purchasing and learning more about these products.
                    </p>

                    <p>This week I conducted an accessibility test of this site and will provide a summary of my
                        findings.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Tools and standards used to evaluate the site</h2>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>I focused on the WCAG 2.1 guidelines since this is not a federally funded site and therefore not
                        subject to section 508. I looked at three factors to determine the accessibility of the website.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Whether the website can be interpreted by the user if they have impairments such as limited
                            sight or other disabilities that would affect their ability to understand information
                            included in the site.</li>
                        <li>Whether a user could operate the website with disabilities like motor impairments.</li>
                        <li>Is the website predictable and set up in a way to correct mistakes?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I evaluated the website by manually reviewing it and using Wave and Lighthouse.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Findings and Results</h2>
                    <p>Using Lighthouse I evaluated the accessibility of the site. </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/Lighthouse accessibility.jpg"
                            alt="Results of Lighthouse test">
                    </a>

                    <p>Overall it gave the website a score of 80/100 indicating several issues:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio</li>
                        <li>Form elements do not have associated labels</li>
                        <li>The browser zoom has been turned off</li>
                        <li>Links do not have a discernible name </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>I also reviewed the site using WAVE and found similar results. The one additional thing
                        identified in WAVE was the use of unordered lists in their dropdown menus.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/Unordered list.jpg"
                            alt="Example of an unordered list message">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Issues and possible solutions</h2>

                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio</h3>

                    <p>The site uses very muted colors likely to create a relaxing experience when viewing it. This
                        makes sense when it comes to the type of product they are selling. </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/Thymes homepage.jpg" alt="Thymes homepage">
                    </a>

                    <p>It’s nice for those who can see but for those who are visually impaired, the lack of contrast can
                        make it difficult for users to use the site. The site tries to fix this by using contrast layers
                        behind the light grey text. On some pages, the image is so light that the white contrast layer
                        blends into the page and you lose the contrast.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/Light contrast.jpg"
                            alt="Example of a page with light contrast">
                    </a>

                    <p>One possible solution to this would be to put a border around the contrast layer.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/Contrast Solution.JPG"
                            alt="Possible solution for contrast issue">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Form elements do not have associated labels</h3>

                    <p>The site handles form labels differently in different places. For example, on the form to sign up
                        for an account or to order goods it uses form labels. In other areas such as the search box and
                        signing up for emails, they have just used placeholders instead of labels. They use light grey
                        text on the placeholder which has very poor contrast and is difficult for the visually impaired.
                    </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/search as is.JPG" alt="Search field without a label">
                    </a>

                    <p>Individuals with cognitive or motor impairments can have difficulty with placeholders because
                        depending on how they are coded, they can act differently. For example, sometimes when you click
                        in the field the placeholder disappears. Other times when you click in the field you have to
                        delete the placeholder to add your information.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, not all screen readers can read placeholder text aloud making it difficult for blind or
                        visually impaired people to know it is there. Without a label they won’t know what to put in a
                        field.</p>

                    <p>The solution here is to include labels in all form fields and make the lines and text darker for
                        more contrast.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/Search with Label.JPG" alt="Search field with label">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>The browser zoom has been turned off</h3>

                    <p>Based on Lighthouse, the ability to zoom and enlarge the page has been turned off. Many visually
                        impaired people rely on zoom to be able to read the contents of a site. This site uses small
                        text which makes it really important to be able to zoom as needed. </p>

                    <p>The obvious solution would be to turn zoom on.</p>

                    <h3>Links do not have a discernible name </h3>

                    <p>In both WAVE and Lighthouse this was identified as a low priority issue. For example, the
                        following href format is commonly used on the site. The name of the image file is the same as
                        the alternative text. This could be a problem for users of screen readers because they wouldn’t
                        have any more information about the image than what’s already in the image name.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 5 img/href.jpg"
                            alt="a sample of the HTML code for the image">
                    </a>

                    <p>On this website I don’t think it’s a big issue because both the image and the alternative text
                        describe the product and gives the user enough information about where they will go when they
                        click the link.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Use of unordered lists</h3>

                    <p>Since the list of products is in alphabetical order, it might make more sense to use an ordered
                        list instead of an unordered list. I navigated through the site with keyboard commands and
                        didn’t find tabbing through the list to be a problem. The bigger problem was getting to the list
                        from the main menu because when I hit return to open the list I still had to navigate through
                        the utilities and main menu of the page to get to the first item of the list. Once I was in the
                        list, tabbing took me from one item to the next alphabetically.</p>
