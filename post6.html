                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">

                    <p>This week I performed an analysis of my second blog post
                        <a href="https://meghanecahill.com/user-science-meghan/post2old.html">“Usable Design
                            Analysis"</a>, .Using Wave and Lighthouse, I identified issues with accessibility that users
                        would experience with my webpage. Based on these findings, I made improvements to the website to
                        address these issues.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Findings</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Lighthouse</h3>

                    <p>In Lighthouse, the page initially had a score of 81 for accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/Lighthouse before.png"
                            alt="Results of Lighthouse test">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>Three errors were identified.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The images did not contain alt attributes (high priority)</li>
                        <li>Links did not have a discernible name (low priority)</li>
                        <li>Lists contain other elements besides list, script and template elenents (low priority)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Wave</h3>

                    <p>Wave had many of the same issues but also found contrast errors in my header. It also noted the
                        underlined text as an alert.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/Wave before.jpg" alt="Results of Wave test">
                    </a>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Issues addressed</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Use of underlining</h3>
                    <p>This was a problem because underlining often means there’s a hyperlink. I had used it to
                        emphasize text which was not good design. To fix it I removed the underline element from my
                        code. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/underline.jpg"
                            alt="Example of removing underlined code">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Missing Alternative Text</h3>

                    <p>None of my images had alternative text. It is important to include for those who have visual
                        impairments and rely on screen readers. The screen reader will read the descriptive text in the
                        alternative text. This makes it clear to the user what the images are. To fix it I added alt
                        text to all of my images.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/Alt text .jpg"
                            alt="Example of adding alternative text">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Empty Links</h3>


                    <p>The page included three placeholder links to Twitter, Facebook, and Github. None of them included
                        the URL to the applicable site. In addition to the URL being missing, there was no text
                        describing the purpose of the link. This would also make it difficult for a screen reader to
                        interpret the purpose of the link. To fix it I added the URL’s and descriptive text.
                    </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/Social links.jpg"
                            alt="Example of adding URL's and labels to hyperlink">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Contrast Errors</h3>

                    <p>The final error identified by Wave but not Lighthouse was a lack of contrast between the
                        background and foreground of my header. I had used a medium blue colored banner and changed it
                        to a darker one. I still got the error when I re-evaluated the page in Wave. It turns out that
                        Wave was thinking that both the foreground and background were white even though the background
                        was dark blue. This turned out to be a false error that I chose to ignore.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/Contrast error.jpg"
                            alt="Picture of Wave contrast error">
                    </a>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Outcome</h2>

                    <p>After making all of these fixes, I re-evaluated my page in Wave and Lighthouse and saw
                        improvement. To move to the revised site, <a
                            href="https://meghanecahill.com/user-science-meghan/post2.html">click here.</a></p>

                    <h3>Lighthouse</h3>

                    <p>My score increased from 81 to 96. This was an 18.5% improvement.
                    </p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/Lighthouse after.png"
                            alt="Results of Lighthouse test">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Wave</h3>

                    <p>All previous errors except the false contrast errors were resolved. </p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 6 img/Wave after.jpg" alt="Results of Wave test">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Challenges</h2>

                    <p>My biggest challenge was trying to get the contrast right on my menu. I spent hours playing with
                        css and html to try and change the contrast with no success. Once I confirmed with my teacher
                        that this was a false error, I was greatly relieved.
                    </p>

                    <p>The other thing was the third issue in Lighthouse which identified unexpected elements were being
                        used in the list elements. I didn’t bother to fix this as it was a low priority and I was
                        concerned that I would break functionality by changing elements in the list.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Use of Bootstrap</h2>

                    <p>I think using Bootstrap is helpful in providing a template to create the website. For the most
                        part, the template supported accessibility. The problems I had were related to not filling in
                        labels and alt text which was based on my customization of the template.</p>
