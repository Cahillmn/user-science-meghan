                    <p>This week I reviewed the data collected on my duration goals and conducted a usability test on my
                        blog. I also learned about creating content experiments using Optimize. This allows me to see if
                        changing features on my site will affect the progress towards my goal. This week’s blog focuses
                        on the data collected on my goals and what I have learned so far.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I learned about my goal’s performance</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Data collected using Google Analytics</h3>
                    <p></p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 9 img/Goal completions.jpg"
                            alt="Graph of goal completions">
                    </a>
                    <p>I had 57 goal completions with the following breakdown:</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 9 img/Goal data.jpg" alt="Table of goal data">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Because my goals were increasing duration in time, the total completion results have duplicates.
                        A person spending one minute on my site shows up under both the 30 second and 1-minute goals. To
                        adjust for this, I’ve noted completion by goal. Completion of goal shows the actual number of
                        times a goal was met. The percentages show that most people spent five or more minutes on my
                        site which is much more than I expected for a blog. I assumed that most people would spend about
                        a minute before leaving.</p>
                    <h3>Results of usability test</h3>
                    <p>I contacted three people to conduct a usability test. I asked them the following questions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Estimate how long you spent on the site (based on the three goals)</li>
                        <li>Which parts of the website were most interesting?</li>
                        <li>Which parts of the website were least interesting?</li>
                        <li>How do you think the site could be improved?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>User 1 said they spent more than five minutes on the site. The two latest blogs with the Google
                        Analytics information were most interesting. They enjoyed seeing the data and my conclusions.
                        The least interesting parts were earlier blogs that just discussed formatting techniques and
                        didn’t include data techniques. They didn’t really see any need for adjustments.</p>

                    <p>User 2 was very similar to user 1. They spent more than five minutes and liked the Google
                        Analytics more than the earlier blogs on design. In terms of improving my site, they suggested
                        expanding the content to do more data analysis.</p>

                    <p>User 3 also spent more than five minutes on the site but found the earlier blogs to be more
                        interesting than the data analytics. They suggested that I should consider using more images or
                        visuals on my site and making periodic updates with pictures.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Setting up my content experiment</h2>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Changes made</h3>
                    <p></p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post 9 img/Before:After.jpg" alt="Table of goal data">
                    </a>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>Because I had duration goals, it was hard to decide on what changes to test. I decided to create
                        a Call To Action (CTA) and changed the subheading on my homepage to encourage people to check
                        back weekly and spend time on my site.
                    </p>

                    <p>I created an A/B test in Optimize and sent users to the two versions of the site. I used a 50/50
                        variant weight, to send users equally to both versions of the page.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <h3>How the process went</h3>
                    <p>I had some difficulties setting up my content experiment in Optimize. It took me a while to
                        notice the code that I had to add to my blog code. After I added it in visual studio code and
                        pushed it to Github it took several hours before I could validate that my installation worked.
                        Once I had validation of the installation, I tested the site but couldn’t get variant 1 to
                        render. After thinking about it for awhile I realized that I never pressed start. Go figure!.
                    </p>
